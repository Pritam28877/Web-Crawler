Sure! Here's a basic readme for a web crawler written in Node.js:

# Node.js Web Crawler

This is a simple web crawler built using Node.js that retrieves the links on a web page and follows them to recursively crawl the entire site.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/node-web-crawler.git
cd node-web-crawler
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the web crawler, use the following command:

```
node index.js <url>
```

Replace `<url>` with the starting URL for the crawler. For example:

```
node index.js https://example.com
```

The web crawler will then crawl the entire site, logging the URLs it visits to the console.

## Customization

The web crawler is very basic and can be easily customized to suit your needs. Some possible customizations include:

- Ignoring certain links (e.g. external links or links to specific pages)
- Adding additional logging or error handling
- Modifying the behavior of the crawler (e.g. limiting the depth of recursion or the number of pages crawled)

Feel free to modify and use this code in any way you see fit!
